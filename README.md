# Omoshiroi Kamo

## 📦 About This Mod

Omoshiroi Kamo is a collection of modern mod backports, rewritten and optimized for Minecraft 1.7.10.
It brings newer mechanics, QoL improvements, and entire systems from later Minecraft versions back into legacy modpacks.

Perfect for GTNH, 1.7.10 tech packs, or any old-version modpack that wants modern features without updating the entire
game.
