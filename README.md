## About This Mod

Omoshiroi Kamo is an open-source collection of modern mod backports for Minecraft 1.7.10. It brings newer mechanics, QoL
improvements, and entire systems from later Minecraft versions back into legacy modpacks.

Prefer for 1.7.10 tech packs, or any old-version modpack that wants modern features.
Being open-source, contributions are always welcome — if you have ideas, fixes, or improvements,
I’d be thrilled to see them!
